# Movie-Recommender-System

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Movie Recommender System! This project focuses on creating a personalized movie recommendation engine using Machine Learning (ML) models. The system analyzes user preferences and movie attributes to provide 5 relevant and tailored movie suggestions.

üîç Features and Highlights:

Content-Based Filtering: Leveraging content-based filtering approaches to recommend movies similar to the ones users have already enjoyed. This method relies on movie attributes like genre, actors, directors, and plot summaries.

Matrix Factorization: Exploring Matrix Factorization algorithms, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS), to decompose user-item interaction matrices and make accurate movie predictions.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the recommender system using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of predictions.

User Interface (UI): Building a user-friendly interface where users can input their movie preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations instantly.
